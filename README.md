<p align="center">This is a eCommerce website template that can be used for Wordpress/Shopify stores.</p>

## Why I built this

- I love E-Commerce stores and this can be used as a store template in the future.
- The goal of thi project is to be light weight, not to use other plugins or frameworks, and only use HTML CSS and JS.

## Challenges

- Flex box may not be the best choice for responsive design because user can not fully control the gap between the columns when moving the device width.
